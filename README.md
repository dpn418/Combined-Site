# Combined-Site
-An IS117 project by Dustin Nguyen

-[AFS Hosting](https://web.njit.edu/~dn236/IS117/Combined-Site/docs/index.html)

-[Github Pages hosting](https://dpn418.github.io/Combined-Site/).

-Currently Github pages is not hosting the images in the img folder for whatever reason, some images are likely disabled please use the AFS hosting instead as the images work properly there. If https:dpn418.github.io/Combined-Site/img/darklock.jpg is 404 then likely all other images are still not being hosted and I have no fix for that.
